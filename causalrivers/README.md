## Scaling up benchmarking of causal discovery for real-world time-series

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

This is the official repository of [CausalRivers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wmV4cIbgl6), the largest real-world Causal Discovery benchmark for time series to this date.
Also check our [Website](https://causalrivers.github.io/) where we will maintain the current leaderboard.

## Leaderboard submission


❗We maintain an active leaderboard for CausalRivers.❗ 
You can submit to this leaderboard by using the [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDcNKLPo0L5ihIV9HDFhhkTWLNzcexsFWXvaU6tb8lPdBlyQ/viewform). 
Here you can submit your raw performance for the different datasets. For the format, please check [example submission file](fantasy_submission.csv) and the [preparation tutorial](6_prepare_leaderboard_submission). 
Note, you don't have to submit results for all datasets (as shown in the example file). 
Further, if you want to integrate the algorithm that produced your scorings, you can submit it along with the predictions and we will include it under [the CD zoo](https://github.com/CausalRivers/experiments/tree/main/causal_discovery_zoo). We will reference it accordingly to your wishes.






## Install

For the core benchmarking package simply run (uses conda, unzip and wget):

```bash
./install.sh
conda activate causalrivers
python 0_generate_datasets.py
```

Alternatively, you can execute the following commands by hand:

```bash
conda env create -f causal_rivers_core.yml
conda activate causal_rivers_core
wget https://github.com/CausalRivers/benchmark/releases/download/First_release/product.zip
unzip product
rm product.zip
python 0_generate_datasets.py
```


If you want to get a working environment for the raven cluster (ELLIS summer school Jena) run: 

```bash
conda create -n causalrivers
conda activate causalrivers
pip install -r cluster_env.txt
```




For the DWD data access, please install: 

```bash
pip install polars-lts-cpu==1.32.2 # This somehow hast the installed after everything.
```




## Functionality

This is the core benchmarking package, which only holds the core functionality and some tutorials on usage:

- How to build your graph subset:  [Custom graph sampling](1_custom_graph_sampling.ipynb)
- How to use the benchmark most efficiently:  [Usage](2_tutorial_benchmarking.ipynb)
- How to sub-select specific temporal windows with certain weather conditions: [Temporal selections](3_tutorial_subselect_weather_condition.ipynb)
- Some general display of dataset properties that might be interesting for users:  [Data distribution](4_data_distribution.ipynb)

## Usage

We use Hydra to organize preprocessing and method Hyperparameters. Along with this we provide functions to load data and score results.
We keep a single baseline strategy (VAR) here that is used as a placeholder and can be replaced with your own method. To check how the scoring works simply run:

```bash
python 3_benchmark.py
```

This will run a var strategy with specified preprocessing on the "confounder 3" dataset and reproduce the scoring. For the remaining experimental results we refer to [the experiments repo](https://github.com/CausalRivers/experiments)

If you want to score your own method on a specific set of graph samples you can simply replace the baseline_method, configure it with hydra and run:

```bash
python 3_benchmark.py label_path=datasets/random_3/east.p data_path=product/rivers_ts_east_germany.csv method=var  data_preprocess.normalize=False  data_preprocess.resolution=6H method.var_absolute_values=False method.max_lag=5
```

Of course you can also use any routine from  [the experiments repo](https://github.com/CausalRivers/experiments), especially concerning Grid searches and result aggregations.
Here, experiments were conducted on a computation cluster with the job submission system [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) and also via [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) configurations.
However, the script can also be used on a single machine.






## CausalRivers Benchmark Dataset Explanation

The dataset consists of **three** `NetworkX` graph structures, **three** metadata tables, and **three** time series in `CSV` file format.
To facilitate matching between these different formats, each graph node shares a unique `ID` with its corresponding time series.

Additionally, the metadata table contains information about the individual nodes.

### Quality Values

The graph construction, particularly the edge determination, involves multiple strategies.
To ensure transparency and reliability, we provide quality markers for each piece of information.
These quality markers are defined as follows:

| Node Value     | Description                                                                 |
|:--------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-1`           | Unknown as target value missing                                             |
| `0`            | Original value                                                              |
| `> 0`          | Value that was estimated or looked up by hand (Check construction pipeline for more details) |

| Edge Value     | Description                                                                 |
|:--------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `origin`       | The step under which the edge was added. E.g., origin 6 references to edges that were added as river splits by hand. |
| `quality_h`    | Sum of the quality of the corresponding Heights estimated of the connected nodes. E.g. 0 references that both height estimates were not estimated. |
| `quality_km`   | Sum of the quality of the corresponding coordinates (X, Y) estimated of the connected nodes. E.g. 0 references that both coordinates were not estimated. |
